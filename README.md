# 📈 Cracking Stock Market Code With AI-Driven Stock Price Prediction Using Time Series Analysis

This project explores stock market prediction using time series analysis techniques. By leveraging historical data and machine learning models (like LSTM), we aim to forecast future stock prices with improved accuracy.

## 🔍 Project Overview

Stock price prediction is one of the most challenging tasks in financial data science. In this project, we use historical stock market data and advanced time series forecasting techniques to:
- Analyze trends and seasonality
- Build predictive models
- Visualize predicted vs. actual prices

We focus primarily on deep learning-based models such as **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)** networks, well-suited for time series forecasting due to their ability to remember long-term dependencies.

## 🧠 Techniques Used

- Time Series Decomposition
- Moving Averages
- Data Normalization (MinMaxScaler)
- LSTM Neural Networks (via Keras/TensorFlow)
- Evaluation Metrics (RMSE, MAE)
- Data Visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn)

## 📊 Sample Workflow

1. **Data Collection:** Download historical stock data from Yahoo Finance using `yfinance`.
2. **Preprocessing:** Normalize features like Open, High, Low, Close, Volume.
3. **Model Building:** Train an LSTM model on time-lagged sequences.
4. **Prediction & Visualization:** Forecast future stock prices and plot against real values
